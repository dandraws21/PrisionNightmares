# PrisionNightmares

This is a Game Design Project, it's not going to be programed... for now...

We made a game with some restrictions - (Thrill, Simulation, Submision).
Need to express these feelings.

Following 4 basic pillars - (History, Esthetic, Mechanics, Tecnology)

**Synopsis**
--------
The history of Craig, a presoner who try to escape from the prision. Here is happening something weird...

## Main features

* Point&Click Movements
* Take decisions, risks, and try to ESCAPE!

* 2D graphics, black stroke and dismal art.
* Adventure Game (HistoryTelling)
* Scenary depressing. THE PRISION!
